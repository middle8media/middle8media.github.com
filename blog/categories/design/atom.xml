<p>This week I got inspired by the ever informative <a href="http://css-tricks.com">CSS-Tricks</a> and the immensely enjoyable <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show</a>, when both Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert shared their take on the tools and services of a professional Web Developer. They talked about <!-- more -->initial upfront costs, recurring monthly costs and their hardware/software of choice, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/web-developer-economics-monthly-service-costs/">Web Economics</a> as Chris Coyier calls it. Webonomics maybe? Maybe not.</p>

<p>This post will focus on my essential hardware and software, my recurring yearly and monthly costs/plans/accounts, as well as how I ingrate all of that into my current front-end development workflow, from blank directory all the way to full deployment. I am not claiming these things to be the best way or the right way or the only way. I am simply sharing my way. So, without further ado, I present to you my professional tricks of the trade.</p>
