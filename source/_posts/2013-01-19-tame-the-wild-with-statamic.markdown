This week I have been developing the web site/web app hybrid of our new independent film venture Indie Film Equities. IFE is the official funding portal for [New River Releasing's](http://newriverreleasing.com) feature length films, a place where Independent Filmmakers and Investors meet. The site is built on WordPress using the [Standard Theme](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=214644&cl=64302), and is set to launch sometime this year *(we are waiting on specific guidelines from the SEC, but that is another blog post)*. As I was building out the membership login/payment functionality<!-- more -->, I was able to  seriously dive into PHP for the first time. PHP is the server-side language that makes up the heart and soul of WordPress and so far it is a lot of fun to work with.

Anyway, Wordpress has been and continues to be a great CMS for myself and my clients, but I have recently discovered a potential game changer for how I develop Content Management Systems, if not a complete game changer then at least a worthy option. I am referring to [Statamic](http://statamic.com/).

Statamic is a dynamic, static site generator.  <code>static + dynamic = Statamic</code>. Pretty clever.

In the words of Statamic's creator [Jack McDade](http://jackmcdade.com/)

<blockquote>Statamic is a dynamic, flat file content management system that’s completely powered by static files. That’s right, there’s no database in between your application and your content.</blockquote>

That sounds pretty awesome to me. Bring it.

There are tons of resources and documentation on the [Statamic Home Page](http://statamic.com/) and the developer community is already robust, which means this platform should be in active development for a while and the third party add-ons should cover a variety of needs. Also, at $29 for a Personal license and $99 for a Professional license, you get a lot of bang for your buck. Without a doubt, I will be buying this for my next project.

Has anyone used this platform? Is anyone developing Add-Ons?

Please share your thoughts and experience.
